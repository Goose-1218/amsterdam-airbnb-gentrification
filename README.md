# 🏘️ Amsterdam Airbnb & Gentrification

## Overview
Exploring Airbnb listings in Amsterdam to see how short-term rentals relate to gentrification patterns, with a focus on neighborhoods like **Jordaan**.  
Based on my IB Extended Essay (gentrification in Jordaan) and continued as part of my AI studies at **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU)**.

## Objectives
- Analyze listing distribution across Amsterdam  
- Compare Jordaan prices vs. other neighborhoods  
- Check property types (entire home vs. private room)  
- Visualize spatial and price trends

## Project Structure
~~~
amsterdam-airbnb-gentrification/
├─ data/            # datasets from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/
├─ notebooks/       # Jupyter notebooks (analysis.ipynb)
├─ src/             # helper scripts (optional)
└─ requirements.txt
~~~

## Tools
- Python • Pandas • NumPy  
- Matplotlib • Seaborn  
- GeoPandas (for maps)

## Next Steps
- Add `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` with EDA  
- Plot Jordaan vs. rest of Amsterdam  
- Try a simple price prediction model (baseline regression)
